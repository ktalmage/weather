# Weather

Welcome to your Weather! The purpose of this program is to let users enter their location and be able to weather information for their area. You can choose from current weather,
tomorrow's weather or a five forecast. In addition, you will receive recommendations on how you should dress for that day based on the temperature.

In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/weather`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'weather'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install weather

## Usage

To use this program, please enter a US Zip code. Then you will be prompted to enter the information you would like : 1) current weather 2) tomorrow's weather or
3) a 5 day forecaset. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
