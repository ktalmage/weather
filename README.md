# Weather

Welcome to Local Weather! The purpose of this program is to let users enter a location to obtain hyperlocal data for the current time.

In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/weather`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'weather'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install weather

## Usage

To use this program, please select a city from the list. From there you can view different weather attributes for your city like: weather, temperature and wind speed.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
